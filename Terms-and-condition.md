terms and conditions for the software and crediting

1. credits-your username and the platform where you shared your code will be added in the credits or in the code i.e //contributed by *user* from *platform*
2. distribution of your own version of sonya's software- distributing modified versions of Sonya's software is perfectly fine but:
•the developer (meighton) still technically owns the software
•the modified software will be posted in this github if the developer (meighton) officially approve it (no.1 applies)
